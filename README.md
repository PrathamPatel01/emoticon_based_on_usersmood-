# emoticon_based_on_usersmood-
Its a basic animation using graphics in c++.
This program is done without the in-built function(circle), Circles are drawn with the help of mid-point theorem in Computer graphics with the valid parameters
The moods are predefined.Example 1 stands for Happy, 2 for Sad, 3 for Neutral, 4 for angry.
lets assume that user is in a cheerful mood and he enters 1, A Happy emoji will pop up
It is done with the help of Switch case.
if User enters a number apart from the predefined numbes, he gets directed out of console screen 
if we use circle function colors can be added to the emoji which will make it look better but since it was task to not use circle function i have done using mid point theorem which is a part of my college syllabus
THANK YOU!
